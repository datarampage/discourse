# discourse
An R wrapper for the Discourse API 

Discourse is a popular message board software that you can self-host.

Currently it only covers authentication and getting a user list, nothing else. That's all I'm using it for at the moment!

The full documentation is available [here](https://docs.discourse.org/).
